# Module 6 Lab 6

## Description

As required by the lab instructions, I have created the frontend for the cats array. It fullfils all the requirements listed on the lab. I have also added the requirements below for clarification:

- Create a BigCats component, in its own file, which uses the cats array (below) to display a styled list of cats.
- Include a unique id and fix the warning about keys
- Create a SingleCat component for rendering each individual cat, and add an image property for each one.
